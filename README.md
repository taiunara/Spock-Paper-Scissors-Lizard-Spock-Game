# Spock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock-Game
I created this game for my Programming 1 class! In it, you'll have fun challenging the computer in an exciting match of Spock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. Choose from five options and see if you can outsmart the computer. The result will display on the screen, showing whether you were the great winner, if there was a tie, or if the computer came out on top.

This project not only brought me joy but also helped me grow significantly as a programmer! The interface is simple, with an engaging design, perfect for exploring game logic and mouse interaction in Processing. Come check it out and play!
