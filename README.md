# 🆙️ **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**  

This is a **fun variation** of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, inspired by the extended version introduced in *The Big Bang Theory*! Built using **Processing (Java)**, this game allows players to compete against the computer with five possible choices: **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock**.  

## 🎮 **Game Features**  
✔️ **Randomized computer choices** for a dynamic experience  
✔️ **Graphical interface** with images and animations  
✔️ **Win, lose, or draw conditions** based on game logic  
✔️ **Replay functionality** to restart the game
